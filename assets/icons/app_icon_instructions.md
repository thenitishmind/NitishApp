# App Icon Instructions

## Creating the App Icon

To create a custom app icon for the Nitish Portfolio Flutter app, you'll need to:

1. **Create a 1024x1024 PNG image** named `app_icon.png` in the `assets/icons/` directory
2. **Design Elements to Include:**
   - Background: Professional gradient (Blue to Purple or similar)
   - Text: "NS" or "N" in modern, clean font
   - Style: Modern, professional, clean design
   - Colors: Match the app theme (Primary blue/purple colors)

3. **Recommended Design:**
   ```
   - Background: Linear gradient from #2563eb (blue) to #7c3aed (purple)
   - Text: "NS" or "N" in white, bold, modern font
   - Shape: Rounded square or circle
   - Add subtle shadow or highlight for depth
   ```

4. **Alternative Option:**
   - Use an online icon generator like:
     - https://appicon.co/
     - https://icon.kitchen/
     - https://makeappicon.com/
   - Upload your design and download the generated icons

5. **After creating the icon file:**
   - Place `app_icon.png` in `assets/icons/`
   - Run `flutter packages get`
   - Run `dart run flutter_launcher_icons:main`
   - This will generate all the required icon sizes for different platforms

## Icon Specifications:
- **Size:** 1024x1024 pixels
- **Format:** PNG with transparency support
- **Background:** Should work on both light and dark themes
- **Content:** Clear, readable, professional

## Colors Used in App:
- Primary Blue: #2563eb
- Purple: #7c3aed
- Background: Various grays
- Text: White/Black based on theme

Once you have created the icon, the flutter_launcher_icons package will automatically generate all required sizes for Android, iOS, Web, and Windows platforms.
