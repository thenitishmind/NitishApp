cd /path/to/your/projects

# 2. Create the Flutter project
flutter create flutter_portfolio
cd flutter_portfolio

# 3. Replace the generated files with provided code
# Copy all files from the provided code structure

# 4. Install dependencies
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Verify Flutter Installation

```bash

```

## üöÄ Platform-Specific Instructions

### Running on Android

1. **Enable Developer Mode:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí About Phone
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Go to Developer Options ‚Üí Enable USB Debugging

2. **Connect Device:**
   ```bash
   # Check if device is connected
   flutter devices
   
   # Run on Android
   flutter run -d android
   ```

3. **Using Emulator:**
   - Open Android Studio ‚Üí AVD Manager
   - Create Virtual Device
   - Select device and API level
   - Start emulator and run app

### Running on iOS (macOS only)

1. **Setup Xcode:**
   ```bash
   # Open iOS Simulator
   open -a Simulator
   
   # Run on iOS Simulator
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

2. **For Physical Device:**
   - Connect iPhone/iPad
   - Trust the computer
   - Run: `flutter run -d ios`

### Running on Web

1. **Enable Web Support:**
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

2. **Run Web Application:**
   ```bash
   # Development server
   flutter run -d chrome
   
   # Build for production
   flutter build web
   
   # Serve built files
   cd build/web
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

### Running on Desktop

**Windows:**
```bash
# Enable Windows desktop
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop

# Run on Windows
flutter run -d windows
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Enable macOS desktop
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop

# Run on macOS
flutter run -d macos
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Enable Linux desktop
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

# Install required packages (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

# Run on Linux
flutter run -d linux
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### GitHub Integration

Update the GitHub configuration in `lib/core/config/github_config.dart`:

```dart
class GitHubConfig {
  /// Your GitHub username
  static const String username = 'your-github-username';
  
  /// Optional: GitHub Personal Access Token for higher rate limits
  /// Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  /// Required scopes: public_repo, read:user
  static const String? token = 'your_token_here'; // or null
}
```

**Benefits of adding a GitHub token:**
- Increases rate limit from 60 to 5000 requests/hour
- More reliable data fetching
- Faster app performance

**To generate a token:**
1. Go to [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `public_repo` and `read:user`
4. Copy the token and update the config file

### Custom Branding

1. **App Name and Icon:**
   ```yaml
   # pubspec.yaml
   name: your_portfolio_name
   description: Your custom description
   ```

2. **Colors and Theme:**
   Update `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` with your color preferences.

3. **Personal Information:**
   Update personal details in relevant screens and components.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"flutter: command not found"**
   ```bash
   # Add Flutter to PATH
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Android License Issues:**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   # Accept all licenses
   ```

3. **Gradle Build Failures:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

4. **iOS Build Issues:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   rm Podfile.lock
   rm -rf Pods
   pod install
   cd ..
   flutter run
   ```

5. **Web Build Issues:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html
   ```

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow Debug Performance:**
   ```bash
   # Always use release mode for performance testing
   flutter run --release
   ```

2. **Large Bundle Size:**
   ```bash
   # Analyze bundle size
   flutter build apk --analyze-size
   
   # Use app bundle for smaller downloads
   flutter build appbundle
   ```

### Environment Specific Issues

**Windows:**
- Ensure Windows 10 SDK is installed
- Run PowerShell as Administrator if needed
- Check antivirus isn't blocking Flutter

**macOS:**
- Update Xcode to latest version
- Install Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Grant necessary permissions in System Preferences

**Linux:**
- Install missing dependencies: `sudo apt-get install curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa`
- Ensure snap is not interfering with Flutter

## üìä Development Workflow

### Recommended Development Setup

1. **Hot Reload for Fast Development:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   # Press 'r' for hot reload
   # Press 'R' for hot restart
   ```

2. **Debugging:**
   ```bash
   # Run with debugging
   flutter run --debug
   
   # Profile mode for performance testing
   flutter run --profile
   ```

3. **Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   flutter test
   
   # Run with coverage
   flutter test --coverage
   ```

4. **Code Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Analyze code
   flutter analyze
   
   # Format code
   flutter format .
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Building Release Versions

**Android:**
```bash
# Debug APK
flutter build apk

# Release APK
flutter build apk --release

# App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**iOS:**
```bash
# Build iOS app
flutter build ios --release

# Create IPA file
flutter build ipa
```

**Web:**
